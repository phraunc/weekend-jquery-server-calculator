## Description

Created functions for all math operations as well as the numberInputs.
Created a GET ajax to get the enteredNumber variable to use on the server side.  

With that, I created post ajax for all operations to include the equals function.  
When the server has the input values from the client, the server then puts the information into the mathEquation array/object.  With that information, the server will then use what ever operation button was pushed, do the calcualtions and then GET post to get them back to the client for the results.  The client then takes that information and renders it to the DOM in 2 sections reserved for current equations and historical equations.  

This repeats until the delete button is used which then erases all arrays and starts again.
